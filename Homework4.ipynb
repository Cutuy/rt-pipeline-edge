        "This homework is very different from previous homeworks. The most signficant change is that this is a __group assignment__ that focuses on your project. You should complete it in collaboration with members of your project group. There is no coding, so you should feel free to complete the assignment in word or whatever format you are most comfortable with. This will be worth a significant amount of your final grade, so please try to do a good job. \n",

For each task, you're highly encouraged to include graphics that aid in your explanations and thought processes. If you need help making these graphics, I recommend taking a look at [yed](https://www.yworks.com/products/yed), a really neat graph editor.\n",

        "For this task you'll be describing what you want to accomplish. Of course some of this can be copy pasted from previous presentations you've done, but there are additional considerations you'll have to make. Specifically you should:\n",
        "* Describe the goal of your project\n",
        "\n",
        "Table tennis is a popular Olympic sport with very few professional players in most countries. It is expensive and can be difficult to learn with low availability of ways to improve. As a result, our overall goal is to build an electronic device that enables an efficient learning experience for table tennis. The device should be capable of detecting data from a collection of sensors, processing that data with standard computation and pre-trained models for real-time analysis, and to send that data to the cloud for more complex machine learning analysis,\n",
        "\n",
        "* What requirements does the project have? For example, what accuracy do you need to create a compelling experience? How fast does it need to run? Are there any privacy concerns? Etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project does not have extreme accuracy requirements: we are targeting beginners, so anything that has a high degree of accuracy towards suggesting the right direction of change for improvement will be sufficient for our design. As a result, we **do want** a high accuracy in the direction of our outputs (e.g. was that game good or bad) but **do not need** high accuracy for more precise purposes (e.g. change the vertical acceleration of the swing 1m/s in order to vastly improve).\n",
        "\n",
        "For any pre-trained model we want to put onto our device's on-board Raspberry Pi, we will need it to run very fast: we want it to display results in near-real-time such that players would be able to seamlessly analyze their plays. However, for any models that are not fast, we would put them on the cloud for **post match analysis** which would arguably be fine even if they had up to an hour of delay. **We do not have privacy concerns**: all the data collected is not particularly sensitive - we do not have any biometric or otherwise personally identifiable information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* What class of machine learning problem is this? Is there overlap between several classes? In this context, a class of problem would be simple classification, natural language processing, vision, or one of the other topics discussed.\n",
