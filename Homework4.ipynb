You should complete it in collaboration with members of your project group. There is no coding, so you should feel free to complete the assignment in word or whatever format you are most comfortable with. This will be worth a significant amount of your final grade, so please try to do a good job. \n",

        "* Describe the goal of your project\n",
        "\n",
        "Table tennis is a popular Olympic sport with very few professional players in most countries. It is expensive and can be difficult to learn with low availability of ways to improve. As a result, our overall goal is to build an electronic device that enables an efficient learning experience for table tennis. The device should be capable of detecting data from a collection of sensors, processing that data with standard computation and pre-trained models for real-time analysis, and to send that data to the cloud for more complex machine learning analysis,\n",
        "\n",
        "* What requirements does the project have? For example, what accuracy do you need to create a compelling experience? How fast does it need to run? Are there any privacy concerns? Etc...\n",
        "\n",
        "Our project does not have extreme accuracy requirements: we are targeting beginners, so anything that has a high degree of accuracy towards suggesting the right direction (aka. binary classification) of change for improvement will be sufficient for our design. As a result, we **do want** a high accuracy in the direction of our outputs (e.g. was that game good or bad) but **do not need** high accuracy for more precise purposes (e.g. change the vertical acceleration of the swing 1m/s in order to vastly improve).\n",
        "\n",
        "For any pre-trained model we want to put onto our device's on-board Raspberry Pi, we will need it to run very fast: we want it to display results in near-real-time such that players would be able to seamlessly analyze their plays. However, for any models that are not fast, we would put them on the cloud for **post match analysis** which would arguably be fine even if they had up to an hour of delay. **We do not have privacy concerns**: all the data collected is not particularly sensitive - we do not have any biometric or otherwise personally identifiable information.\n",
        "\n",
        "* What class of machine learning problem is this? Is there overlap between several classes? In this context, a class of problem would be simple classification, natural language processing, vision, or one of the other topics discussed.\n",

        "\n",
        "* Describe your data collection procedure. How will you store the data? How will you prevent accidentally teaching the network something you didn't mean to. For example, If I trained a network with images all from the same room, it might learn to look for that background and not work anywhere else.\n",
        "\n",
        "Given the real-time stream nature of sensor data and batch-processed near-real-time nature of enginnering features, the data is stored in a circular buffer residing in main memory first, then \"dumped\"/serialized to JSON files (when a threshold of # of pieces of data is reached) and saved both locally and to the cloud (Firebase Cloud Storage).\n",
        "\n",
        "To prevent overfitting during data collection, we will ask testers to \"swing the paddle and serve the ball multiple times\", which will create a rich dataset that differs in the frequency of swings, the direction/angle of swings (which slightly affects gyroscope), and quality of hits. Since we plan to only collect a relatively small amount of data, we do not have to select testers based on ping-pong players' statistical distribution.\n",

        "\n",
        "We will need 10 samples each containing at least 15 \"swing & hit\" pairs. This gives as 150 \"swing & hit\" pairs in total, and each pair will be the data collected from sensors during ~30 seconds. Given the current sample rate of 5 data points/sec and 40 Bytes per data point, each pair will take 6KB. The dataset will be at least 9MB in memory and probably 2x that size in persist media.\n",
        "\n",
        "We will need to ask 10 different players to play around 1 minute each, which theoretically results to a total of 10 minutes. In reality, this should take a minimum of half an hour to an hour at most, including finding users, set-up, transition, and post-processing time between test users.\n",

We will determine how to label the players in a subjective manner by considering their background (self-reported beginner versus expert) and each cast a vote for how to label that player. Bias may be inserted given our subjective/non-quantitative approach to estimating a player's performance. Additionally, personal relationships (e.g. giving a close friend a \"Good Player\" label) may also result in bias.\n"

However, given that each sequence usually has a length of 11~14 and does not exceed 16 timesteps, the loss of ong term memory may not affect negatively.\n",
        "\n",
        "Dense layers are used in conjunction with: a) ELU activation for \"leaking out\" the negative part of the gradient, which would boost training, b) disabled using bias to force to model to learn the gradient instead of bias - Good for preventing the model learning a Zero weight matrix and a Constant bias matrix as was the case without such limitations, bad for preventing overfitting. This negative effect is mitigated by multi layers of Dense-Dropouts.\n",
        "\n",
